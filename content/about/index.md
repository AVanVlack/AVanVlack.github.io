I have had a lifelong passion for technology and computers. I was the elementary school kid lugging a 386 tower, similar in size to myself at the time, onto the bus for show & tell of the components.

### Todays technologies that keep me excited:

- Machine Learning: As a way to process complex datasets, such as in the [Garden Minder](https://github.com/Volution-Labs/garden-server) project in order to use water as efficiently as possible.
- Physical Computing: Seamlessly integrating technology to improve our everyday lives.
- XR Computing: Teleporting into new worlds.

Do you have an interest in one of these technologies or computing in general? **Let's talk!**
